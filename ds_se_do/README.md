# Data Science Meets Software Engineering Meets DevOps

The goals of this lecture are to:

* Gain an appreciation for the varying skill sets and activities required
to actually put “data science” to work in production environments.
* Internalize that to successfully build a data science product
(as with most products), it takes a wide range of skill sets.
* Understand high level attributes of each “specialization” and what
I look for / expect them to contribute to a product/team.
