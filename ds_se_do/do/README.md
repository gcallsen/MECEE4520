# DevOps (DO)

From our lecture slides, The "DevOps Engineer" cares about:

* Scalable
* _Functional Systems_

This is a short demonstration showing one exercise a DevOps engineer
might go through when attempting to take the "software engineer" code
and make it more scalable and functional as a production _system_.
